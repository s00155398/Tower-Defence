# Tower Defence Project by Gerard Connor

## Introduction
Hi my name is Gerard Connor and I created this project in order to learn and develop my skills within Unreal Engine whilst also expanding further in certain areas such as Level Design and 3d Modelling. My aim with this project was to create a somewhat enjoyable game in the Tower Defence genre using what skills I currently possessed at the time aswell as demonstrating what I could achieve with said skills. To create the aforementioned project I made use of Unreal Engine to create and design the project itself, Blender to create 3d models for in game objects. For more complicated models I made use of Adobes Mixamo to source the models for things such as Enemies. For audio I made use of various websites such as soundbible.com and freemusicarchive.org.

## Gameplay
The game features design where the player must build defences to destroy incoming waves of enemies who are inexorably advancing towards the Tele-core. If the player fails to protect the core then they will fail the level. To avoid this they must build from a selection of towers that have their own strengths and weaknesses such as fire rate, damage and special effects. The game employs a point based system to build these towers wherein the player gains points by defeating enemies and spend points to build the towers themselves. The game has three levels with each increasing in difficulty as the player progresses from level to level.
