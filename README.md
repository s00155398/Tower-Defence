# Tower Defence Project by Gerard Connor

## Introduction
Hi my name is Gerard Connor and I created this project in order to learn and develop my skills within Unreal Engine whilst also expanding further in certain areas such as Level Design and 3d Modelling. My aim with this project was to create a somewhat enjoyable game in the Tower Defence genre using what skills I currently possessed at the time aswell as demonstrating what I could achieve with said skills.

## Gameplay
The game features design where the player must build defences to destroy incoming waves of enemies who are inexorably advancing towards the Tele-core. If the player fails to protect the core then they will fail the level. To avoid this they must build from a selection of towers that have their own strengths and weaknesses such as fire rate, damage and special effects. The game employs a point based system to build these towers wherein the player gains points by defeating enemies and spend points to build the towers themselves. The game has three levels with each increasing in difficulty as the player progresses from level to level. As with towers, the game features multiple types of enemy where they each are inherently different from one another, such as movement speed, health and special abilities.
